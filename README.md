# React Hooks Practice

## UseState Hook

1. While using useState if we make a function where the initial param is set we'll call it once. If we don't want to do that we can reference and initialize the function that does the same thing to run on every page load.

2. If we're dealing with objects the objects that we change is not updated it's just overwritten so if we have two properties and update one the second one will just vanish. To prevent that we need to spread the object and then update the property (e.g setCount(prevState => {...prevState, count: prevState.count - 1})). Also the more desired way is just to make two hooks and store them seperately and then update if we want to. (No bigger example in the fn script here I think it's pretty self explanatory)


## UseEffect Hook

1. That's the hook that is resposible for every change on the site. If you want to change any state or practically anythin use this hook.

2. The function after return is imporant, while we're doing something that requires cleaning it later. (More on this in the expample itself).

3. Remeber about wise selection of when we want to change something in the second param in the hook itself.
